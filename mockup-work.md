# Mockup work

The rolling list of mockups Fleet Command needs (owner, 2026-10-30: "we'll begin with a rolling list
of mockups needed"). Every mockup is an interactive three.js page, written up in OpenSpec first, and
passes two approvals before it reaches the game (CLAUDE.md section 4):

1. **Drafted**: the write-up and the page exist and are published.
2. **Approved for build**: the owner approves it as the design to build.
3. **Approved for implementation**: the owner approves putting it in the game. Only then does game
   code start, in a separate request.

Every mockup is checked into the repository, the page in `docs/mockups/` and its record in
`docs/artifacts/<name>/` (owner, 2026-10-30: "All mockups are to be checked into repo especially when
they are html claude artifacts"). The **mockup tracker** lists every link and stage, and is where the
owner approves: https://claude.ai/artifact/1fgArACeshJ4CAo9aXZV5F (record in `docs/artifacts/mockup-tracker/`).
If the owner changes accounts, every mockup, the tracker and the survey are republished from the new
account and every link here is updated.

| # | Mockup | Stage | OpenSpec change | Page | Link |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Primary game flow | Drafted (2026-10-30, v1) | `game-flow` | `docs/mockups/game-flow.html` | https://claude.ai/artifact/FhyyMm5JL58SwRFAKRRBbk |
| 2 | In-game UI | Listed | `battle-console` (to write) | `docs/mockups/battle-console.html` | |
| 3 | Look dev | Listed | `look-dev` (to write) | `docs/mockups/look-dev.html` | |

New mockups are added at the bottom with the owner's words, never renumbered.

## 1. Primary game flow

Owner, 2026-10-30: "let start with the primary game flow in three js".

- **Main menu**: Campaign, Skirmish, Options, Quit.
- **Skirmish**: preset scenarios (for now). The scenario gives you points to pick ships and configure
  their loadouts, then you play the game.
- **Campaign** (no story yet): a world map made of a hexagon grid, viewed at a perspective angle like
  Civilization V, with zoom. Ships sit on little standees, and so do planets and stations.
  - The world map has panels: **shipyard**; **ship configuration**, with an ammunition and parts shop
    to buy and sell; **recruiting center**. These open only at a friendly station or planet.
  - Otherwise, **missions**: patrol, enemy station assault, planetary assault, convoy ambush, convoy
    defense, assassination, capture a ship.
  - Click **Deploy** on a mission, play the game, and at the end return to the campaign map.

Design: `openspec/changes/game-flow/`. References: SFC2 manual printed pages 74-89 (menus, skirmish,
campaign map, supply dock, shipyard); SFC3 manual printed pages 26-37 (skirmish points, refit by
hardpoint, resupply, officers, hex facilities, missions).

## 2. In-game UI

Owner, 2026-10-30. Ship systems on the left.

- **Main panels**: helm, repairs, science, transport, tactical, comms, point defense, map, fleet, power,
  in-game menu and settings.
- **Ship overview panels**:
  - **Shields and weapons** (the primary display): the ship's schematic, top down, with its weapons and
    other ship systems. A very compressed version first; a larger view with more detail can be
    expanded later.
  - Shield array.
  - Sensor systems.
  - Transport and cargo (perhaps combined with the transporter system above).
  - Tractor beam.
  - Shuttles and fighters.
- **Ship 3D view**: the player's ship, a target camera, the weapons capacitor, a speed slider, energy
  and reactor output, the enemy view, the enemy targeting system (point and right click), and a 3D
  display of the ship's shield array.

Notes for its write-up: CLAUDE.md section 7 bans sliders for whole-number allocation; speed is a
continuous value, so the write-up argues the speed slider as an exception (the-federation allowed one
for tow distance) or proposes discrete boxes, for the owner to choose.

## 3. Look dev

Owner, 2026-10-30: "this is the look dev area".

- **Detail level**: decide how detailed the ships are crafted (survey A1 says mid detail).
- **A design language for each faction**:
  - colour palettes, hull plating and hull patterns, insignia, hull details (vents, markings, greebles,
    windows), liveries;
  - hull shape, silhouette, and the ship elements that have gameplay impact.
- **Fully destructible hull pieces, and hull interiors** (see Crab Breeze), with a new skill written
  for this.
- **Effects**: engines and engine plumes, explosions, hits, warp.
- **Lighting**: navigation lights, hull lighting, registry lighting. Baked for efficiency; real-time
  where it does not cost too much (`light-baking`).
  - The owner's reference, 2026-10-30, an airliner lighting guide: "logo lights will be cool, but we'll
    need additional hull lighting too, as that highlights details on the ship in dark lighting
    conditions". The aircraft lights, as ship lights:

    | Aircraft light | On a ship | Look |
    |---|---|---|
    | Logo lights (on the tail fin) | Floodlights on the faction insignia and the registry | Steady pools on the markings |
    | Wing inspection lights | Floods from the hull washing the nacelles, pylons and wings | Steady, cool white |
    | Anti-collision strobes, white (wingtips, tail) | Strobes at the ship's extremities: nacelle tips, the stern | Short double flash |
    | Anti-collision beacons, red (top and bottom) | Red beacons on the dorsal and ventral hull | Slow pulse |
    | Position lights (red left, green right, white aft) | Port red, starboard green, white aft | Steady |
    | Landing lights | Forward docking lights | Bright beams, on when docking |
    | Taxi and turnoff lights | Lower side lamps for manoeuvring near stations | Dimmer, wider |
    | (the owner's addition) | **Hull floodlighting**: lamps set into the hull that graze its plating, so panel lines, vents and greebles read when the ship is in shadow | Steady, baked |
